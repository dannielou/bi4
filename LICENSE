"THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42): I wrote this projet. As long as you retain this notice you 
can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a 
beer in return. Eric DANNIELOU.

ps : some other files, especially grid.js, do not belong to this project, we provide a copy for convenience, but they belong to another
author and they are covered by another license.
